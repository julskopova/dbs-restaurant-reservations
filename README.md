Normalized schema with integrity constraints, seed data, and non-trivial SQL queries.

## Highlights
- Relational design (PK/FK, UNIQUE/CHECK), DDL/DML; seed data
- 20+ SQL queries: joins, GROUP BY/HAVING, set operations, subqueries, division pattern
- Transaction-safe updates (COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
- Docs in **Czech** (`docs/report.html`); this README is the **English summary**
- Data is synthetic and anonymized
